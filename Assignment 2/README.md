# M18 CSE441 Database Systems Assignment 2
Ridiculously bad C++ implementation of Two Phase Merge Sort using maps, vectors and Insertion Sort, so slow it makes you cry.

### To generate input and check output
From assignment pdf look through how to install gensort and valsort

#### To compile
```
g++ sort.cpp -o sort
```

#### To Run
```
./sort <inputFileName> <outputFileName> <asc / desc> <col1> <col2>
```
